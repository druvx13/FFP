                                Preamble

 The FFP (Freedom For People) License is a free and permissive license
 intended to maximize human freedom by ensuring that software,
 documentation, art, media, data, and other copyrightable works remain
 available for anyone to use, study, modify, and share.

 Version 2.0 strengthens the original v1.0 text by adding clearer
 definitions, an explicit Indemnification clause, stronger Warranty and
 Liability disclaimers with jurisdictional carve-outs, an Export
 Controls notice, explicit AI/ML training permissions, a path for
 future license versions, and a governing law provision.

 This License grants broad permission to use, copy, modify, distribute,
 and sell the Work, while requiring that recipients receive a copy of
 this License and that copyright and attribution notices are preserved.

 This License includes a patent license grant from Contributors and
 protects the commons by terminating patent rights granted under this
 License if a recipient initiates patent litigation alleging that the
 Work infringes a patent.

 The Work is provided without warranty, and the Licensor and
 Contributors disclaim liability for damages.

 The precise terms and conditions follow.

                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 2.0 of the FFP (Freedom For People)
 License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
 of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "Legal Entity" means the union of the acting entity and all other
 entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
 with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means
 (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
 management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or
 (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
 shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

  "Work" means the original work of authorship made available under
 this License, including software, documentation, hardware design
 files, art, data, media, or any other copyrightable subject matter,
 as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached
 to the work.

  "Source Form" means the preferred form for making modifications,
 including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 source, and configuration files.

  "Object Form" means any form resulting from mechanical transformation
 or translation of a Source Form, including but not limited to compiled
 object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media
 types.

  "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any
 modifications or additions to the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
 that is intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by a
 Contributor, whether in Source Form or Object Form, whether submitted
 by an individual or on behalf of a Legal Entity.

  "Derivative Work" means any work that is based upon the Work or any
 Contribution and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
 elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
 original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
 Derivative Works do not include works that remain separable from, or
 merely link to (or bind by name to), the interfaces of the Work and
 Derivative Works thereof.

  "Distribute" (or "Distribution") means to reproduce, publish,
 transfer, make available, or otherwise convey a copy of the Work,
 Contributions, or Derivative Works to any third party, whether in
 Source Form, Object Form, or any other form, by any means. Mere
 interaction with a user through a computer network, without transfer
 of a copy, is not Distribution.

  "You" (or "Your") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising
 permissions granted by this License.

  "Licensor" means the copyright holder(s) or the Legal Entity
 authorized by the copyright holder(s) that grants this License.

  "Contributor" means the Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 on behalf of whom a Contribution has been submitted to the Licensor
 and accepted for inclusion in the Work.

  "Effective Date" means the date on which You first exercise any right
 granted under this License.

 1. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted on a worldwide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable basis,
 provided the conditions stated in this License are met.

 You may use, reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
 publicly perform, sublicense, and Distribute the Work and Derivative
 Works for any purpose, including commercial, private, educational,
 research, or governmental purposes.

 2. Grant of Copyright License.

 2.1 Licensor Grant.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor
 hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
 royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
 Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
 and Distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source Form or
 Object Form.

 2.2 Contributor Grant.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
 hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
 royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
 Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
 and Distribute such Contributions and Derivative Works thereof in
 Source Form or Object Form.

 2.3 Additional Terms.

 You may Distribute the Work or Derivative Works under additional or
 different terms, provided that:

   (a) such additional or different terms do not conflict with,
       restrict, or override the rights granted to recipients under
       this License; and

   (b) recipients are always able to obtain the Work under this
       License.

 Any additional terms that purport to limit the rights expressly
 granted by this License shall be null and void with respect to the
 Work as licensed hereunder.

 3. Grant of Patent License.

 3.1 Patent Grant.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
 hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
 royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in Section 8) patent
 license to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, import, and
 otherwise transfer the Work and Contributions, where such license
 applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
 that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
 the combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
 Contribution(s) were submitted.

 3.2 Patent Litigation (Defensive Termination).

 If You initiate, maintain, or threaten patent litigation — including
 a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit — against any person or
 Legal Entity alleging that the Work, a Contribution incorporated in
 the Work, or a combination of the Work with any other software,
 constitutes direct, contributory, or induced patent infringement,
 then all patent licenses granted to You under this License for the
 Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed or
 threatened.

 4. Conditions of Distribution.

 4.1 License Text Requirement.

 When You Distribute the Work, Contributions, or Derivative Works,
 You must:

   (a) include a complete, unmodified copy of this License in a file
       named LICENSE (or COPYING) placed in the root directory or
       another prominent and accessible location; and

   (b) provide a URI or hyperlink to the canonical license text if
       the distribution medium makes inclusion of the full text
       impractical.

 4.2 Preservation of Notices.

 You must retain, in all copies of the Work and Derivative Works that
 You Distribute, all copyright notices, patent notices, trademark
 notices, attribution notices, and license notices that are present
 in the Source Form of the Work, except where removal is expressly
 required by applicable law.

 4.3 No Lockdown of the Licensed Work.

 When You Distribute the Work or Derivative Works, You may not impose
 legal, contractual, or technological measures — including Digital
 Rights Management (DRM) and Technical Protection Measures (TPM) —
 that effectively prevent recipients from exercising the rights
 expressly granted to them under this License with respect to the
 Work or Derivative Works.

 This section does not restrict:

   (a) agreements or technical measures unrelated to the exercise of
       rights in the Work itself;

   (b) encryption, authentication, or security measures applied to
       the Work, provided such measures do not prevent authorized
       recipients from accessing the Work under this License; or

   (c) measures required by applicable law.

 4.4 Hardware and Physical Works.

 Where the Work includes design files for hardware or physical objects,
 this License grants rights only to the extent that applicable law
 recognizes copyright or related rights in such design files. This
 License grants no patent rights in hardware except as expressly
 stated in Section 3.

 4.5 AI and Machine Learning.

 You may use the Work, Contributions, and Derivative Works as training
 data, fine-tuning data, or evaluation data for machine learning models,
 and may incorporate outputs of such processes into Derivative Works,
 subject to the conditions of Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. Models
 trained on the Work are themselves Derivative Works and are subject to
 this License only to the extent that the resulting model reproduces
 substantial portions of the Work in its outputs.

 5. Contributions (Inbound = Outbound).

 By submitting a Contribution to the Work, You hereby grant the
 Licensor and all recipients a license to Your Contribution under the
 terms of this License, unless You and the Licensor have executed a
 separate written agreement specifying different terms.

 If You submit a Contribution and wish it to be governed by different
 license terms, You must clearly indicate those terms in writing at the
 time of submission, and the Contribution will be accepted only upon
 the Licensor's explicit written agreement.

 You represent and warrant that You are legally entitled to grant the
 rights set out in this Section and that each of Your Contributions is
 Your original creation or that You have sufficient rights to submit
 the Contribution on the terms of this License.

 6. Trademarks.

 This License does not grant any right to use any trade name, trademark,
 service mark, logo, or product name of the Licensor or any Contributor,
 except as required for (a) reasonable and customary use in describing
 the origin of the Work, (b) reproducing required copyright or
 attribution notices, or (c) both.

 7. No Endorsement.

 Nothing in this License shall be construed to permit You to assert or
 imply that the Licensor or any Contributor sponsors, endorses, is
 affiliated with, or has certified You or Your use of the Work, without
 prior written permission from the Licensor or the relevant Contributor.

 8. Termination and Reinstatement.

 8.1 Automatic Termination.

 Your rights under this License terminate automatically and immediately,
 without notice, if You materially fail to comply with any term of this
 License, including the conditions of Section 4 (Conditions of
 Distribution) or Section 3.2 (Defensive Termination).

 8.2 Reinstatement for Cure.

 If You cease all violations of this License and cure the violation
 within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the violation (or within
 thirty (30) days of receiving written notice from the Licensor), then
 Your license from that copyright holder is reinstated:

   (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
       and finally terminates Your license in writing; and

   (b) permanently, if the copyright holder does not provide written
       notice of the violation within sixty (60) days after the
       cessation of all violations.

 Reinstatement under Section 8.2 does not affect any right the copyright
 holder may have to seek remedies for Your violation of this License.

 8.3 Patent Termination.

 If Your license is terminated under Section 3.2 (Defensive
 Termination), it is not subject to reinstatement under Section 8.2.

 9. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK AND ALL
 CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT,
 AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND
 CORRECTNESS OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU.

 IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
 THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, BUT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE
 MINIMUM WARRANTY REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

 10. Limitation of Liability.

 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
 THE LICENSOR, ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO
 YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CLAIM, LOSS, COST, OR DAMAGE OF ANY
 KIND — WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE
 OR STRICT LIABILITY), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY, OR OTHERWISE — ARISING
 OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE, THE WORK, ANY CONTRIBUTION,
 OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 THIS LIMITATION COVERS ALL CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES, INCLUDING DIRECT,
 INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE
 DAMAGES, AND LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, BUSINESS, OR GOODWILL.

 IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
 OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE LIABILITY OF
 THE LICENSOR, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, AND CONTRIBUTORS SHALL BE LIMITED TO
 THE MINIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

 11. Indemnification.

 You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Licensor,
 Contributors, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and
 agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages,
 losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising
 from or relating to:

   (a) Your use or Distribution of the Work or Derivative Works;

   (b) Your violation of any term of this License;

   (c) any claim that Your Contribution infringes any third-party
       intellectual property right; or

   (d) any negligent or wrongful act or omission by You in connection
       with the Work.

 12. Export Controls.

 The Work may be subject to export control laws and regulations,
 including without limitation the Export Administration Regulations
 (EAR) of the United States and regulations of other jurisdictions.
 You are solely responsible for complying with all applicable export
 and re-export control laws and regulations in connection with Your
 use, distribution, or other transfer of the Work.

 13. Acceptance.

 By exercising any right granted under this License, or by submitting
 a Contribution, You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and
 conditions of this License. If You do not agree to these terms, You
 may not exercise any rights granted hereunder.

 14. Severability.

 If any provision of this License is held by a court of competent
 jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect,
 such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining
 provisions. In such case, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall
 be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and
 enforceable while preserving the original intent.

 15. Entire Agreement.

 This License constitutes the entire agreement between You and the
 Licensor with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
 prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, and
 representations, whether written or oral, relating to such subject
 matter.

 16. Later Versions.

 The FFP License Project may publish revised or updated versions of this
 License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
 You may always use, copy, modify, or Distribute the Work under the
 terms of the version under which you received it. If the Licensor
 specifies "version 2.0 or later," You may also choose to follow the
 terms of any later published version.

 17. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

 This License is an international license intended for worldwide use.
 In the absence of a contrary choice agreed in writing between the
 parties:

   (a) this License shall be governed by and construed in accordance
       with the principles of international intellectual property law
       and, where applicable, the law of the jurisdiction in which the
       Licensor is domiciled;

   (b) disputes arising under or in connection with this License shall
       be resolved, to the extent possible, through good-faith
       negotiation between the parties; and

   (c) if negotiation fails, disputes shall be submitted to binding
       arbitration or the courts of competent jurisdiction in the
       Licensor's domicile, unless both parties agree in writing to
       another forum.
