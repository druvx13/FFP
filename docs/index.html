                                Preamble

 The FFP (Freedom For People) License v2.0 is a free and permissive
 license intended to maximize human freedom. It grants broad permission
 to use, copy, modify, distribute, and sell the Work, while requiring
 that recipients receive a copy of this License and that copyright and
 attribution notices are preserved.

 New in v2.0: clearer definitions (Legal Entity, Source Form, Object
 Form, Effective Date), AI/ML training permission, contributor warranty,
 indemnification, export controls, entire agreement clause, version
 upgrade path, and governing law provision.

 Distribute the Work for any purpose, including commercial and educational purposes.

 2. Grant of Copyright License.

 2.1 Licensor Grant — perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
 irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivatives, display, perform,
 sublicense, and Distribute the Work in Source Form or Object Form.

 2.2 Contributor Grant — same scope for each Contribution.

 2.3 Additional Terms — must not conflict with, restrict, or override rights granted
 herein; recipients must always be able to obtain the Work under this License.

 3. Grant of Patent License.

 3.1 Each Contributor grants a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
 irrevocable patent license to make, use, offer for sale, sell, import, and transfer the Work,
 limited to claims necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or combined with the Work.

 3.2 Defensive Termination — If You initiate, maintain, or threaten patent litigation
 alleging the Work constitutes patent infringement, all patent licenses granted hereunder
 terminate as of the date such litigation is filed or threatened.

 4. Conditions of Distribution.

 4.1 Include a complete copy of this License with any Distribution (LICENSE or COPYING file,
 or provide a URI if full inclusion is impractical).
 4.2 Preserve all copyright, patent, trademark, attribution, and license notices.
 4.3 No DRM or TPM may prevent recipients from exercising their rights under this License.
 4.4 Hardware design files — rights granted only to the extent copyright law applies.
 4.5 AI/ML Training — You may use the Work as training or evaluation data. Models are

 is Your original creation or that You have sufficient rights to submit it.

 6. Trademarks. No trademark rights granted except as needed to describe the Work's origin.

 7. No Endorsement. Nothing herein permits You to claim endorsement by the Licensor.

 8.3 Patent Termination under 3.2 is not subject to reinstatement.

 9. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND. JURISDICTIONS THAT PROHIBIT FULL EXCLUSION SHALL LIMIT WARRANTIES TO THE

 TO THE MINIMUM PERMITTED BY LAW.

 11. Indemnification.

 You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Licensor and Contributors from and
 against all claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising from Your use, Distribution,
 violation of this License, or any claim that Your Contribution infringes a third-party right.

 12. Export Controls. You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable export
 and re-export control laws in connection with Your use or transfer of the Work.

 13. Acceptance. By exercising any right granted herein, You accept this License in full.

 14. Severability. Invalid provisions are modified to the minimum needed to be enforceable.

 15. Entire Agreement. This License is the complete agreement on its subject matter.

 16. Later Versions. The FFP License Project may publish later versions of this License.
 You may use the version under which you received the Work, or any later version if the
 Licensor specifies "version 2.0 or later."

 17. Governing Law. Governed by international IP law principles and the law of the
 Licensor's domicile. Disputes resolved first by good-faith negotiation, then arbitration
 or courts of competent jurisdiction.

      <h4>3.1 Patent Grant.</h4>
      <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in Section 8) patent license to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work and Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by the combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work.</p>

      <p>This License does not grant any right to use any trade name, trademark, service mark, logo, or product name of the Licensor or any Contributor, except as required for (a) reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work, or (b) reproducing required copyright or attribution notices.</p>

      <h3><span class="section-id">7.</span> No Endorsement.</h3>
      <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed to permit You to assert or imply that the Licensor or any Contributor sponsors, endorses, is affiliated with, or has certified You or Your use of the Work, without prior written permission.</p>

      <h3><span class="section-id">8.</span> Termination and Reinstatement.</h3>
      <h4>8.1 Automatic Termination.</h4>

      <h4>8.2 Reinstatement for Cure.</h4>
      <p>If You cease all violations and cure the violation within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of it (or of receiving written notice), then Your license from that copyright holder is reinstated: (a) provisionally, unless the copyright holder explicitly terminates it in writing; and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder does not provide written notice of violation within sixty (60) days after cessation.</p>
      <h4>8.3 Patent Termination.</h4>
      <p>If Your license is terminated under Section 3.2 (Defensive Termination), it is not subject to reinstatement under Section 8.2.</p>

      <h3><span class="section-id">10.</span> Limitation of Liability.</h3>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CLAIM, LOSS, COST, OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND — WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY, OR OTHERWISE — ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE, THE WORK, ANY CONTRIBUTION, OR THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
      <p>THIS LIMITATION COVERS ALL CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, BUSINESS, OR GOODWILL.</p>
      <p>IN JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE LIABILITY OF THE LICENSOR, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, AND CONTRIBUTORS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MINIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

      <p>By exercising any right granted under this License, or by submitting a Contribution, You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License. If You do not agree to these terms, You may not exercise any rights granted hereunder.</p>

      <h3><span class="section-id">14.</span> Severability.</h3>
      <p>If any provision of this License is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. In such case, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving the original intent.</p>

      <h3><span class="section-id">15.</span> Entire Agreement.</h3>
      <p>This License constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Licensor with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, and representations, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter.</p>
