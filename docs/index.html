FFP (FREEDOM FOR PEOPLE) LICENSE
                              Version 1.0

 Copyright (C) [YEAR] [LICENSOR NAME]

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document. You may also distribute modified copies of this
 license document for the sole purpose of formatting changes or
 translation, provided that the legal meaning and effect of the License
 is not altered and that the modified copy is clearly marked as an
 unofficial translation or formatting variant.

                                Preamble

 The FFP (Freedom For People) License is a free and permissive license
 intended to maximize human freedom by ensuring that software,
 documentation, art, media, data, and other copyrightable works remain
 available for anyone to use, study, modify, and share.

 This License grants broad permission to use, copy, modify, distribute,
 and sell the Work, while requiring that recipients receive a copy of
 this License and that copyright and attribution notices are preserved.

 This License also includes a patent license grant from Contributors,
 and it protects the commons by terminating patent rights granted under
 this License if a recipient initiates patent litigation alleging that
 the Work infringes a patent.

 The Work is provided without warranty, and the Licensor and Contributors
 disclaim liability for damages.

 The precise terms and conditions follow.

                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 1.0 of the FFP (Freedom For People) License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "Work" means the original work of authorship, including software,
 documentation, hardware design files, art, data, or media, that is
 initially distributed under this License by the Licensor.

  "Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any
 modifications or additions to the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
 that is intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by a
 Contributor, whether submitted by an individual or on behalf of a legal
 entity.

  "Derivative Work" means any work based upon the Work or Contributions,
 such as a modification, translation, adaptation, or compilation, which
 would require permission under applicable copyright law.

  "Distribute" (or "Distribution") means to provide, transfer, publish,
 or convey a copy of the Work, Contributions, or Derivative Works to a
 third party, whether in source form, binary form, or any other form.

  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, without
 transfer of a copy, is not Distribution.

  "You" (or "Your") means the individual or legal entity exercising
 permissions granted by this License.

  "Licensor" means the copyright holder(s) or entity authorized by the
 copyright holder(s) that initially distributes the Work under this
 License.

  "Contributor" means the Licensor and any other individual or legal
 entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been submitted or
 distributed under this License.

 1. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted worldwide, royalty-
 free, non-exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable, provided the stated
 conditions are met.

 You may use the Work and Contributions for any purpose, including
 commercial, private, educational, or governmental purposes.

 You may reproduce the Work and Contributions, prepare Derivative Works,
 and Distribute the Work, Contributions, and Derivative Works.

 2. Grant of Copyright License.
 2.1 Licensor Grant.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants
 to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable
 (except as stated in Section 8) copyright license to reproduce, prepare
 Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
 Distribute the Work.

 2.2 Contributor Grant.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
 grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
 irrevocable (except as stated in Section 8) copyright license to
 reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
 perform, sublicense, and Distribute such Contribution and Derivative
 Works thereof.

 2.3 Additional Terms.

 You may Distribute the Work or Derivative Works under additional terms,
 provided that such terms apply only insofar as they do not conflict
 with, restrict, or override the rights granted to recipients under this
 License.

 Recipients must always receive the Work under this License as well.

 3. Grant of Patent License.

 3.1 Patent Grant.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
 grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
 irrevocable (except as stated in Section 8) patent license to make,
 have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
 Work and Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent
 claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
 their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 with the Work.

 3.2 Patent Litigation (Retaliation).

 If You initiate patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-
 claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
 Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
 contributory patent infringement, then all patent licenses granted to
 You under this License for the Work and Contributions shall terminate as
 of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Conditions of Distribution.
 4.1 License Text Requirement.

 You must include a copy of this License with any copy of the Work,
 Contributions, or Derivative Works that You Distribute, in the form of
 a LICENSE file, documentation, or other reasonable and accessible
 location.

 4.2 Preservation of Notices.

 You must retain, in the Work and in any Derivative Works that You
 Distribute, all copyright notices, license notices, and attribution
 notices that are present in the Work, except where removal is required
 by law.

 4.3 No Lockdown of the Licensed Work.

 When You Distribute the Work or Derivative Works, You may not impose
 legal, contractual, or technological measures that prevent recipients
 from exercising the rights granted to them under this License with
 respect to the Work or Derivative Works.

 This section does not restrict agreements or measures that are unrelated
 to the exercise of rights in the Work itself.

 4.4 Hardware and Physical Works.

 Where the Work includes design files for hardware or physical objects,
 this License grants rights only to the extent that applicable law
 recognizes copyright or related rights in such design files.

 This License grants no rights in patents except as expressly granted in
 Section 3.

 5. Contributions (Inbound = Outbound).

 Any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work shall
 be licensed under the terms of this License.

 If a Contributor wishes to submit a Contribution under different terms,
 such Contribution shall not be considered a Contribution under this
 License unless the Licensor explicitly agrees in writing.

 6. Trademarks.

 This License does not grant permission to use any trade name, trademark,
 service mark, or product name of the Licensor or any Contributor, except
 as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
 the Work or reproducing required notices.
 7. No Endorsement.

 The names of the Licensor or Contributors may not be used to endorse or
 promote products derived from this Work without specific prior written
 permission.

 8. Termination and Reinstatement.

 8.1 Automatic Termination.

 Your rights under this License terminate automatically if You fail to
 comply with the conditions set forth in Section 4 (Conditions of
 Distribution) or Section 3.2 (Patent Litigation).

 8.2 Reinstatement for Cure.

 If You cease all violation of this License, then Your license from a
 particular copyright holder is reinstated:

   (a) Provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
       and finally terminates Your license; and

   (b) Permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify You of the
       violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
       cessation.

 8.3 Patent Termination.

 If Your license is terminated under Section 3.2 (Patent Litigation), it
 shall not be reinstated.

 9. Disclaimer of Warranty.

 THE WORK AND CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
 OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
 NONINFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
 THE WORK IS WITH YOU.

 10. Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, OR CONTRIBUTORS BE
 LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
 OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION
 WITH THE WORK, CONTRIBUTIONS, OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

 THIS DISCLAIMER COVERS ALL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE
 OR LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 11. Acceptance.

 By exercising the rights granted under this License, You accept and
 agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License. If You
 do not agree to these terms, You may not use, copy, modify, or
 Distribute the Work.

 12. Severability.

 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal, or
 unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality, and
 enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be
 affected or impaired thereby.
