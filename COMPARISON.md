## Key Distinguishing Features of FFP

### 1. **Patent Protection with Retaliation**
FFP provides explicit patent grants while including retaliation provisions that terminate patent rights for aggressors. This is similar to Apache 2.0 but more aggressive than MIT/BSD.

### 2. **No Lockdown Provision**
FFP explicitly prohibits imposing measures that prevent recipients from exercising their rights. This is unique among permissive licenses.

### 3. **Cure Provisions**
FFP allows reinstatement of rights if violations are cured, with a 60-day grace period. This is more generous than many licenses.

### 4. **Broad Scope**
FFP explicitly covers software, documentation, art, media, data, and hardware designs, making it versatile for various types of works.

### 5. **Inbound = Outbound**
FFP clearly states that contributions are licensed under the same terms, preventing licensing confusion.

## License Philosophy Comparison

### Permissive Licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, FFP)
**Philosophy**: Maximize adoption and flexibility by imposing minimal restrictions.

**FFP's Position**: Among permissive licenses but with added patent protections and anti-lockdown provisions.

### Copyleft Licenses (GPL, MPL)
**Philosophy**: Ensure software freedom by requiring derivative works to remain open.

**FFP's Position**: Not copyleft. FFP prioritizes flexibility and adoption over ensuring derivatives remain open.

## Compatibility Summary

### Licenses FFP Can Generally Combine With:
- ✅ MIT
- ✅ BSD (2-Clause and 3-Clause)
- ✅ Apache 2.0
- ⚠️ MPL 2.0 (with care)

### Licenses FFP May Have Issues With:
- ⚠️ GPL v2/v3 (incompatible due to different philosophies)
- ⚠️ LGPL (similar issues)
- ⚠️ AGPL (incompatible)

### General Rule:
FFP is most compatible with other permissive licenses. Combining with copyleft licenses typically requires releasing under the copyleft license.

## Choosing the Right License

### Choose FFP if you want:
- ✅ Permissive licensing with patent protection
- ✅ Patent retaliation against trolls
- ✅ Explicit prohibition against lockdown measures
- ✅ Broad coverage (software, docs, art, data, hardware)
- ✅ Clear definitions and terms
- ✅ Cure provisions for violations

### Choose MIT/BSD if you want:
- ✅ Maximum simplicity
- ✅ Widest recognition
- ✅ Shortest license text
- ✅ Minimal conditions

### Choose Apache 2.0 if you want:
- ✅ Well-established license with legal vetting
- ✅ Patent protection with contribution clarity
- ✅ Change documentation requirements
- ✅ Apache Software Foundation association

### Choose GPL v3 if you want:
- ✅ Strong copyleft protection
- ✅ Ensure derivatives remain open
- ✅ Prioritize user freedoms
- ✅ Prevent proprietary forks

## Conclusion

The FFP License occupies a unique position in the open-source licensing landscape:

- **More protective than MIT/BSD** due to patent grants and anti-lockdown provisions
- **Similar to Apache 2.0** in patent approach but simpler compliance
- **Fundamentally different from GPL** due to permissive (non-copyleft) nature
- **More flexible than MPL** due to lack of file-level copyleft

Choose FFP when you want a modern, permissive license with patent protection that doesn't impose the compliance burden of copyleft licenses.
